## Database migration best practices

- **Use `change` Method**: Use the `change` method for reversible migrations instead of `up`/`down` methods whenever possible. Rails can automatically reverse most common operations.
- **Small, Focused Changes**: Keep each migration focused on a single logical change for clarity and easier troubleshooting
- **Zero-Downtime Deployments**: Consider deployment order and backwards compatibility for high-availability systems
- **Separate Schema and Data**: Keep schema changes separate from data migrations for better rollback safety
- **Index Management**: Create indexes on large tables carefully, using concurrent options when available to avoid locks
- **Naming Conventions**: Use clear, descriptive names that indicate what the migration does
- **Version Control**: Always commit migrations to version control and never modify existing migrations after deployment
